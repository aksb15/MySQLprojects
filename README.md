# ðŸ“Š SQL Practice Notebooks

A collection of SQL reference materials and practice exercises to maintain and expand my database skills.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

In my current role, I primarily work with existing data structures and focus on querying and analysis. While I occasionally use `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, or `VERSION AS OF` statements, I don't frequently create tables or perform complex database administration tasks.

However, I believe in staying sharp and prepared. This repository serves as my personal SQL reference libraryâ€”containing notes, examples, and practice exercises for the full spectrum of SQL operations that I've studied and may need to implement in future projects.

## ðŸ“š What's Inside

- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Table creation, schema design, and structural modifications
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Advanced INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- **Query Optimization**: Performance tuning and best practices
- **Advanced Functions**: Window functions, CTEs, and complex joins
- **Version Control**: Time-travel queries and historical data access
- **Practice Exercises**: Real-world scenarios and problem-solving

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

Keeping these skills current ensures I'm ready to:
- Take on more complex database projects
- Contribute to schema design discussions
- Troubleshoot and optimize existing systems
- Adapt quickly to new database environments
